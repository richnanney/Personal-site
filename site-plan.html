      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The general purpose of the website is to quickly provide a refresher to a player's chosen character for the game super smash brothers melee for the nintendo gamecube. Since there's 26 characters with way too many matchups to cover, I'll only be covering Marth's matchup info for this project. Trust me, this will fullfil the requirements. There's a lot to know!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience will mainly be newer players or people who are new to a given character. The hope is to write it in a manner that a newer player can understand, but a veteran won't get bored by minutia.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        Welcome to F-air Guides! The site will only contain information on Marth for now, but hopefully someday in the future we'll expand to all of the top characters.
        Before we can discuss strategy or advanced techniques, we need to talk fundamentals. As a Marth player your fundamentals are everything. 
        Mastering the core aspects of the game greatly benefits you, even more so than when playing most other characters. 
        It is absolutely crucial that you be spot on with all of your basics; and among all things that could be considered "fundamental" to Marth, 
        I believe that the two most important are: Movement and Spacing. Spacing is extremely difficult to master, and all but impossible to perfect. 
        Good spacing requires good movement. Getting comfortable moving with Marth will be your first learning goal.
        Dashing
        Although it's not wise to think that jumping is bad, try to remember that as Marth you are most threatening when grounded. 
        As you may already know, Dash Dancing is the basis for all of your ground movement. It is performed simply by tapping 
        left and right repeatedly on the analog stick while grounded. If your taps are done shortly after each dash and before the maximum dash distance is reached, 
        then the dash animation will be canceled by a dash in the opposite direction. Dash Dancing is maintaining this state of constant dashing. 
        With proper timing you can also chain together multiple dashes in the same direction, which is known as Fox Trotting.
        Running
        During matches you will be spending much of your time dashing, but running is important too. If you tap, 
        and then hold the analog stick left or right for a long enough period of time you will initiate a run. 
        During your running animation your options are limited to: Shield, Jump, Grab, Running Attack, UpSmash, and Crouch. 
        Crouching during a run will end your running animation, allowing you to use any of your standard grounded options, many of which are not possible during a run. 
        This is known as Run Cancelling. Using a run cancel followed quickly by a Dtilt is something you should practice early.
        Jumping
        There are different heights of jumps in Melee. If you press jump and release it quickly enough, you will do a Short Hop that is much lower than your full jump height. 
        Marth is a generally "floaty" character, and falls rather slowly in the air. However, you can Fast Fall by tapping down on the analog stick while falling. 
        Keep in mind that if you're trying to fast fall after a jump that you must tap down after the apex of your jump.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Match-ups]</h3>
      <p>
        Fox:
        Fox is generally considered to be the overall best character in Melee. He has unmatched versatility of playstyle, high speed, an amazing punish game, 
        and a practically unattainable skill cap. Depending on who you ask Marth may be the most difficult character among the top tiers for Fox to deal with. 
        Due to how commonly Fox is played and how potentially dangerous he can be, you cannot afford to not know how to play against him. 
        Basically, if you aren't good against Fox, you aren't good at melee.
        Captain Falcon:
        Within the higher tiers of characters, I would say there are two that could be considered Marth's worst nightmares: Sheik and Captain Falcon. 
        Falcon has an incredible punish game on Marth. If he lands a solid hit or grab you can potentially die from 0%, regardless of what stage you're on. 
        His terrific punish game combined with the fastest ground speed of any character, as well as the longest range Dash Dance, 
        makes him a particularly difficult matchup for Marth.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Tech]</h3>
      <p>
        General Tech: Auto-Cancel
        Description / How To Perform
        You can reduce the amount of landing-lag after aerial attacks by timing your landing at the correct portion of the attacks animation. 
        The correct timing for when you should land is different for each attack, but is always near the end and/or start of the animation. 
        When an aerial attack is auto-cancelled, the amount of landing-lag is reduced to your characters regular jump landing-lag, in Marth's case this is 3 frames.
        General Tech: Fast Fall
        Description / How To Perform
        Pressing down on the analog stick after the apex of your jump (i.e. while falling) will cause your character to fall much faster than usual. 
        Your character will continue to fast fall until either landing on the ground/platform or taking a hit.

        Especially useful after a Short Hop, fast falling is essential to your movement in Melee. It is one of the most important skills to learn when beginning as a new player.
